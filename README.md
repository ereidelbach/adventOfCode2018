===================

# Project Description

The repository is the home of my submissions for the [2018 Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2018/) competition. As this is my inaugural year participating in the competition, I opted for a familiar language and plan to use Python for all of my submissions.  That said, I'm considering branching out to JavaScript or even R, so stay tuned!
